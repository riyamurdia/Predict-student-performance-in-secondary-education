Predict student performance in secondary education using Data Mining Methods
Data mining techniques, particularly educational data mining, have been effectively used to develop automated systems for educational purposes. 

For our project, we employed these methods to predict secondary school students' final grades using various machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and logistic regression—implemented in R. Additionally, we assessed the impact of including first and second-year grades (G1 and G2) on predicting final grades (G3) and compared this to models excluding G1 and G2 to better understand their predictive value.
