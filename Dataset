In this project, I use dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repositoriy.

The "Student Performance" dataset, donated on November 26, 2014, is designed to predict student performance in secondary education (high school).
It falls under the Social Sciences subject area and is used for both classification and regression tasks in data analysis. 
This dataset is multivariate, consisting of 649 instances and 30 features. Each feature is of integer type, which suggests that the variables are either discretely quantitative or have been encoded from categorical data for analytical purposes. 



Additional Information

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. 
The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. 
Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). 
In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. 
Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. 
It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).
